* Introduction
  This is a step by step tutorial for new Rails learners to learn how
  Twitter and Bootstrap works and to how to use Twitter Bootstrap to provide
  your application with modern layout and styling.

  You can follow the steps below to create a working Rails application. This tutorial
  was writing in Emacs Org Mode.
  
* [0/4] Part One: Build a Rails application with [[http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/][Twitter Bootstrap]]
  1. [ ] Initialize a new Rails application
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       rails new bootstrap_tutorial
     #+END_SRC
  2. [ ] Change into the newly created Rails application directory and clone
     [[https://github.com/troywill/twitter-bootstrap-for-beginners][this tutorial]] from Github.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       cd bootstrap_tutorial
       git clone https://github.com/troywill/twitter-bootstrap-for-beginners.git
     #+END_SRC
  3. [ ] Create a “home” controller and “home/index”, "home/about", "home/contact" pages
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       rails generate controller home index about contact --skip-stylesheets
     #+END_SRC
     - Note the use of `--skip-stylesheets` since we will use Twitter Bootstap's stylesheets
  4. [ ] Set the default route to home/index in file:../config/routes.rb
     #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
       root 'home#index'
     #+END_SRC
